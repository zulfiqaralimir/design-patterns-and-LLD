# 🔁 Suggested Learning Path (Combo)

To get the most out of this repo and master **OOP + LLD + Design Patterns**, follow this structured path:

1. **[Refactoring.Guru](https://refactoring.guru/)**  
   Learn OOP concepts and Design Patterns visually with step-by-step examples.

2. **[Educative.io – Grokking the Object-Oriented Design Interview](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-object-oriented-design-interview)**  
   Solve real-world LLD interview problems and practice structured design thinking.

3. **Your Own Repo (This One!)**  
   Use this repository to **implement, practice, and store your own solutions**.  
   Add UML diagrams, patterns, and LLD problems as you learn.

4. **[GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)** or **YouTube**  
   Reinforce tricky concepts with extra explanations and coding practice.

5. **[LowLevelDesign.io](https://lowleveldesign.io/)** + GitHub Repos  
   Dive deeper into **advanced design concepts** and **project-based implementations**.



## 🧭 Pro Tip
- Start with **visual learning** (Refactoring.Guru).  
- Move to **problem-solving** (Educative.io).  
- Use **this repo for practice & notes**.  
- Reinforce with **GeeksforGeeks / YouTube**.  
- Level up with **LLD.io & advanced repos**.
