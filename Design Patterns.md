## üèóÔ∏è Types of Software Design Patterns

Design Patterns are broadly classified into **three main categories**:

1. **Creational Design Patterns**  
   - Focus on **object creation mechanisms**.  
   - Help make the system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.  
   - Examples: Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype.  

2. **Structural Design Patterns**  
   - Deal with **object composition** and relationships.  
   - Help ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire system doesn‚Äôt need to change.  
   - Examples: Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Proxy.  

3. **Behavioral Design Patterns**  
   - Focus on **object collaboration and communication**.  
   - Define how objects interact and distribute responsibility.  
   - Examples: Observer, Strategy, Command, Chain of Responsibility, Iterator, Mediator, State, Template Method, Visitor.
